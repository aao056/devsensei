**DevSensei** testing and debugging app is a versatile tool for developers who want to streamline their workflow and simplify the process of testing and debugging API endpoints. With a user-friendly interface

## Run:

1.  `git clone https://github.com/duckduckcodes/devsensei`

2.  `cd devsensei`

3.  `npm install`

4.  `npm start`

then you can edit `src/renderer`

## Todo:

 -  [ ] **Link tabs to their content:** When a tab is clicked, its corresponding content should be displayed. Make sure to properly associate each tab with its content.

 -  [ ] **Add clicked tab to activeTabQueue:** When a tab is clicked, add it to the activeTabQueue state so that its content remains visible even when the user navigates away.

 -  [ ] **Remove content and tab from activeTabQueue when tab is closed:** When a tab is closed, remove both the tab and its content from the activeTabQueue state so that it no longer appears in the UI.

 -  [ ] **Enable user to create new requests:** Implement a way for the user to create new requests in the UI, such as a form or button. This may require updating the state to store new requests.

 -  [ ] **Enable user to delete requests:** Implement a way for the user to delete existing requests from the UI, such as a button or context menu. Make sure to properly update the state to remove the deleted request.

 -  [ ] **Finish response container code:** Complete any remaining implementation for the response container, such as displaying the response data or handling errors.

 -  [ ] **Fix bugs in request container, specifically related to params:** Identify and fix any bugs in the request container, especially those related to handling request parameters. This may require refactoring or updating existing code.
